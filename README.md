### Greetings! 

Welcome to my Github Profile; I have a long Indian name (Panchajanya) but I also go by a slightly shorter Indian name (Pancham). 
Find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/panchajanya-banerjee/

I currently work as a Data Scientist on the Customer Intelligence and Analytics Team at Consumers Energy. 

I completed my PhD from the University of Southern California in 2019, working primarily on Computational Astrophysics. Present obsessions include Tensorflow, Deep Reinforcement Learning, 2D Game Design and Electronic Music Production.

Current active projects: 
- access-spotify - A Python package to query the spotify API for all the music data one could possibly want, to visualize, analyze etc etc
- convnet-feature-extractor - A Python package to extract and visualize features from different ConvNet architectures
- fpl-data-analyzer - A Python package to download and analyze the data for the Fantasy Premier League 2020-21

I have also been toying with generating neural network based visual art and music, though these efforts are still in their nascent stages. 

I am currently in the process of mastering my first album (EP?) for release on streaming services. You can check out the draft version on my Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/howdoesinstantkarmasleep/sets/songs-for-floating-first-draft
